The [tomviz project][tomviz] is developing a cross platform, open source
application for the processing, visualization, and analysis of 3D tomography
data. It is currently at an early stage of development, but is already capable
of displaying, visualizing, and interacting with 3D reconstructions of
tomographic data. In addition basic alignment and tomographic reconstruction are
available, with Python scripts that can be modified in the interface to
experiment with different techniques.

The tomviz project is developed principally by [Marcus D. Hanwell][Hanwell] and
[Utkarsh Ayachit][Ayachit] at [Kitware, Inc.][Kitware], and [David A.
Muller][Muller] and [Robert Hovden][Hovden] at [Cornell University][Cornell]
under DOE Office of Science contract DE-SC0011385.

Installing
----------
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/OpenChemistry/tomviz/blob/master/docs/images/animation_nponcarbon1_small.gif">

We recommend downloading the current [stable release](../../releases)
but also provide nightly binaries built by our [dashboards][Dashboard] for
Windows, macOS, and Linux.

It is best to ensure your operating system is up to date before installing tomviz.

__Windows__: Follow the installation instructions, double click on the tomviz
icon to launch application. __Mac OS X__: After downloading tomviz double click
to launch installation. After reading the License Agreement, drag the tomviz
icon into your Applications directory – or anywhere else you would like to store
the application. The first time you open tomviz, you will need to right-click on
the application icon and select ‘open’. It will ask you if you are sure you wish
to open it, click the ‘open’ button. This is only required the first time
launching the application. It can be opened by double clicking all future times.
__Linux__: A Linux binary (dmg) is provided and tomviz can also be built from
source. See [instructions for building](BUILDING.md) found in the BUILDING.md
document.

A Quick Tutorial
----------
  1. Open a sample dataset by clicking “Sample Menu > Reconstruction ” at the
     top menubar.
  2. Create a 3D volumetric visualization by clicking “Visualization > Volume” at the top menubar.
  3. Interact with your volume in the center panel titled “RenderView”.

User Guide
----------
Start by watching this short video to [see tomviz in action][tomviz_in_action].

The [tomviz user guide](/docs/TomvizBasicUserGuide.pdf) is available for more detailed information to get started.

Known Issues
------------

* On Mac OS X, tomviz built against Qt 5.5 will report several warnings of the form "0x7feeac460480 void QWindowPrivate::setTopLevelScreen(QScreen *, bool)( QScreen(0x7feea9e60200) ): Attempt to set a screen on a child window. (:0, ). These warnings can be ignored.
